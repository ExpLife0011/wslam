\chapter{Architecture}
    \section{High Level Overview}
        The system is composed of 4 main components
        \begin{itemize}
            \item wslflt.sys
            \item wslcore.dll
            \item wslsvc.exe
            \item wslam.exe
        \end{itemize}
    \section{wslflt.sys}
    \paragraph{}
    Wslflt.sys is minifilter driver that contains the requirued sensor for monitoring process' activity. It the components that filter disk I/O,
    process creation/termination and thread creation/termination.
    \paragraph{}
    It's key components are the process filter, file filter, event dispatcher, the communication framework and the detection heuristics.
    \section{wslcore.dll}
    \paragraph{}
    This dll is an abstraction of the wslflt.sys driver. It contains the communication logic between kernel-mode and user-mode and exports
    multiple callbacks to an integrator. It's main purpose is to hide the filtering and detection logic and to provide an easy way to integrate
    the system in a complete security solution.
    \paragraph{}
    \section{wslsvc.exe}
    \paragraph{}
    Wslsvc.exe is Windows service that integrates the previously mentioned DLL.
    \section{wslam.exe}

\chapter{Introduction}
    \section{Motivation}
        \paragraph{} With the release of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Consisting of two new kernel-mode drivers, lxcore.sys and lxss.sys, that implement
        more than 100 linux system calls, it opened an attack surface that was not covered by monitoring tools or AV vendors.
    \section{Objectives}
        \paragraph{} The main objective is to provide a partial solution to this new security problem. It should defend a system from bashware, suspicious
        interraction between WSL processes and Windows processes and to provide system administrators with enough logs to properly respond to
        incidents, while not disrupting the user experience.

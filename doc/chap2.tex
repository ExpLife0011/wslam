        \subsection{File System Legacy Filter and Minifilter Drivers}
            \paragraph{}
            A Legacy Filter driver is a kernel-mode that could attach to a device's stack. In the context of file system filtering, these
            filter drivers could intercept file system I/O operations. Developing legacy filter drivers was quite troublesome and led to 
            many incompatibilities between filter drivers. This is one of the reasons for which minifilter drivers were added.
            \paragraph{}
            Minifilters have the same abilities as file system legacy filter drivers, but they are easier to develop and are overall safer. Their
            load order no longer depends on the attach order, but on a predefined value named altitude. Minifilters are managed by FltMgr, which is
            a legacy filter driver implemented by microsoft.
    \section{C++ in Kernel Drivers}
        \paragraph{}
        By default, msvc does not support C++ for kernel-mode drivers.
